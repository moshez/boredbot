BoredBot is a minimal Python application which showcases several of the
typical complications that make applications interesting to install --
hooking up to several API endpoints, depending on double-digit third
party packages and requiring several interacting processes.

The talk shows, step by step, how to start from the application code,
and how to add deployment-friendly features, until it gets to reliable
builds and dependable deployments to targets such us Amazon ECS
or Google Compute Cloud. It assumes code on GitHub and images on
image stores like DockerHub or Bitnami will get leaked, that
PyPI will be down when you need it the most and that processes
crash.
